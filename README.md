Sentiment Analysis of Movie reviews:

1. Using natural language processing and machine learning techniques to analyze the sentiment or emotion expressed in movie reviews.
2. Goal of a movie sentiment analysis project might be to understand how people feel about a particular movie, or to predict how successful a movie is likely to be based on the sentiment of the reviews it receives. A dataset of movie reviews and the corresponding ratings or labels indicating the sentiment of the reviews (e.g. positive, negative, neutral). Accuracy is 90.02%.

Fake News Prediction_using_GRU AND Bidirectional LSTM RNN(Deep learning):

1. Fake news detection is the process of identifying false or misleading information in news articles or online media. A machine learning model for fake news prediction used techniques such as natural language processing and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to analyze the content of news articles and predict whether they are likely to be genuine or fake. 
2. Bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM) networks are a variant of LSTM networks that can capture dependencies between words in a text by processing the text in both forward and backward directions. This project is useful for fake news detection where the meaning of a word may depend on the context provided by the words that come before and after it in the text. Accuracy 92.22%.
